# Serene Grove Guess - A Full-Stack Java Number Guessing Game

A classic number guessing game reimagined as a full-stack web application. This project features a lightweight Java backend that serves the game logic via a REST API, powering a beautiful and immersive "enchanted forest" themed web interface.

**This project demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with a robust backend handling logic and a creative frontend, built with modern web technologies, handling all presentation.**

### **Features**

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** A random number is generated on the server for each new game.
- **RESTful Backend:** The Java server exposes simple API endpoints (`/guess`, `/restart`) for game interactions.
- **Themed User Interface:** A "Serene Grove" theme with a living background, parchment paper UI, and nature-inspired fonts and colors.
- **Poetic Feedback:** Instead of simple "high/low" messages, the UI provides themed feedback like "The wind rustles the high branches...".
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to look great on different screen sizes.
